# 📚 Algorithms and Concepts

This repository contains Java implementations of various algorithms and concepts commonly used in computer science.

## Algorithms and Concepts

1. **Ceiling of a Number Using Binary Search**  
   This algorithm calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number using binary search.

2. **Floor of a Number Using Binary Search**  
   This algorithm computes the largest integer less than or equal to a given number using binary search.

3. **Line Segment Intersection**  
   Determines whether two line segments in a 2D plane intersect, and if so, finds the point of intersection.

4. **Merge Sort**  
   A sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them together.

5. **Prim's Algorithm (MST)**  
   An algorithm that finds the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph by starting with an arbitrary vertex and adding edges until all vertices are connected.

6. **Quick Sort**  
   A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays based on the pivot.

7. **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**  
   Solves the optimization problem where a salesman must visit a set of cities and return to the origin city with the least possible cost.

8. **Topological Sort**  
   An ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

9. **Convex Hull**  
   Finds the smallest convex polygon that encloses a set of points, implemented using algorithms like Graham's Scan or Jarvis's March.
